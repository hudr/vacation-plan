# Vacation Plan

Let's imagine you wanna trip in your vacation time.
How can u decide the best weather and place to go?

There's no problem anymore. This application should help
you to find the best period for your relax time :)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Java JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - To run some stuff
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - It'll help you to install some dependencies
* [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - It'll help you to install some dependencies too

### Installing

It's a little bit easy to install, just follow next steps:

1 - Download the project as zip or just clone it with [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hudsonr2018/vacation-plan.git
```


2 - After install NodeJS and Yarn just open project folder in your cmd and run:

```
$ yarn install
```
OR
```
$ npm install
```

It's time to wait yarn/npm install all dependencies.
* [YARN VS NPM](https://x-team.com/blog/yarn-vs-npm/) - This guide will tell you why I actually prefer to use Yarn.


## Running

1 - Extract the mobile_tech_assignment.zip file inside root project folder, and run in your cmd:

```
cd mobile_tech_assignment
$ java -jar stubby4j-6.0.2.jar -d tech_assignment_mobile_stubs.yml
```


2 - It's time to run your app:

```
$ yarn start
```
OR
```
$ npm start
```


3 -  Done! Now open the app in browser!

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - Javascript framework used in this project
* [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) - Bootstrap Dependency, until now (for me) the best way to bootstrap in react
* [Stubby4j](https://github.com/azagniotov/stubby4j) - An HTTP stub server for testing application interactions with web services (REST, etc) & external system stubbing for easy testing
